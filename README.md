# Advent of Code 2019
## Description
The project contains my framework for AoC and solutions for the year 2019.

## Usage
To try solutions for different days, edit `Programs.cs` and change the `day` variable to whichever you want.

The `input generator` looks for input files in the `input` folder named `day{day}_default.txt`. If an input is missing, it will try to download it from the AoC website using your login cookie provided in `appsettings.json`.
